##Electric Imp##
This is currently just a set of functions which can be copied to do basic things on CommonSense since there is no way to include other files in the [IDE](https://ide.electricimp.com/) (and the [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/) language) at this moment.

###CommonSense Developer Portal###
Have a look at the tutorial available at the [CommonSense Developer Portal](http://developer.sense-os.nl/Devices/electric-imp/). You can also find the documentation for our API there.
